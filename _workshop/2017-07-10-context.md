I don't keep paper towels in my apartment. It's a detail of my lifestyle that required a small amount of effort and has resulted in habits that I'm pretty happy with. The main benefit is that I don't send countless paper towels to the landfill, and it's really just because there are no paper towels here to throw out.

My point isn't about paper towels though. The point is that differences, even small or incremental ones, in our everyday context can be a big deal. I think about this a lot regarding how to reach more of my creative goals, such as being consistent with this newsletter or pursuing drawing and painting more regularly. The barrier for many of these activities is that they require a minimum amount of uninterrupted focus and time, maybe 1-2 hours or so, before anything of value is produced. It doesn't sound like that much time, yet I typically derail myself before the threshold by checking text messages, Snapchat, email or tackling other easy tasks.

You know what would be so easy? Putting my phone on silent in the other room and turning the wi-fi off on my computer. What's harder is mentally letting go of those things. I've selfishly pursued a field of work where no one's life directly depends on me doing my job, and in my personal life, it would be unusual if something really could not wait a few hours—so my stress over emails and messages is pretty voluntary.

Aside from distraction, there's another component: getting into the right headspace. Take a cue from modern TV—the opening titles for so many shows nowadays are absolutely dope and completely abstract. They are artworks, designed to prime you for the story and fictional world that follows, to put you in a mood where The Upside Down totally makes sense. For my purposes, a subtle way to prime myself might be putting on a certain type or music or a five minute meditation session.

I know there's nothing new here, but I think it's always a good reminder that we're not little brains working inside vacuums. We are people susceptible to the myriad stimuli around us, and if we have a bit of control over those stimuli, then let's make the best of it.
