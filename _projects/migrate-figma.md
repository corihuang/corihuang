title: Migrating A Small Team to Figma
type: designops
layout: project
---

We knew we could work better, but we weren't sure how.

---

## Context

Prior to this proposal, the design team used Sketch, InVision, and Abstract as our toolkit to design, prototype, and collaborate. In an effort to design more cohesively as a team and enable scalable design practices and components, we began evaluating tools that would also support a shared design system, including InVision DSM.

The ideal toolkit setup enables the design team to easily share design assets, components, styles, and documentation to magnify the value of each of our design outputs. Additionally, we require prototyping and collaboration capabilities to show how our designs work, gather feedback from stakeholders, and share design specs. Figma is the tool that best suits these needs. More details on the tool comparisons can be found in Tools and Medium Notes.

### Why?
- Consolidating services
- Better design system support - centralized design assets pushed out to everyone
- Real time collaboration
- Support for the same features as existing design toolkit
- Figma value prop deck

Pricing and account types

As for pricing, we have a 5 license minimum and the cost is $540 per Full Access user which is invoiced annually upfront. Figma does not charge for viewer seats. Viewers in Figma are still able to collaborate through comments, exporting assets, inspecting, and grabbing code for the developer handoff process. Here is more information on the different user types in Figma Organization. 

Billing
We rely on a quarterly true-up model to capture additional users over the original size of the contract: 

- We will reach out to the Admin(s) and billing contact two weeks prior to each quarterly billing cycle to validate any added Full Access users 
- Once confirmed, we will issue a prorated invoice co-termed with your annual agreement for any Full Access users above your original contract size
