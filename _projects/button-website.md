## Context
In March of 2019 I worked on big redesign of the homepage. It was a blue sky project intended to explore a new visual branding direction and get our team out of a rut so we could rethink how to make Button look like the tech company that it is and wanted to look like. The redesign went well, and this project was the bigger overhaul that followed.

### The Team
- VP of Marketing, business strategy and content
- Marketing team, copywriting
- CEO, CRO, CIO, stakeholders
- Web developer, all things engineering
- Me, design lead


## What Came After
As with any product, there were plenty improvements that we designated out of scope for the project, but wanted to address in a future iteration. The ones we later took on included:
- Integrating Contentful so that select sections of website copy could be easily updated by the marketing team
- Developing a resource center to curate white papers, industry news, and thought leadership content
