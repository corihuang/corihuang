One of the things you can get away with fairly easily as a kid, but not so much as an adult, is ducking out of social responsibilities. The awkward shy kid is easily forgiven, where the awkward rude adult is often avoided. Being successfully social takes a lot of energy, requiring emotional labor and a nuanced understanding of human interactions. The ability to understand and navigate emotions and build social connections—efforts that I'll collectively refer to as emotional labor—is a skill that is trivialized if not ignored. Sure, the term "EQ" as a soft skill has been thrown around the workplace lately, but when it comes to forging meaningful relationships and building communities, we seem to take for granted the work that family members and community leaders put forth.

Author G. Willow Wilson is an American raised as an atheist who converted to Islam and lived in Egypt for several years. Reflecting on her time in Egypt, Wilson recognized that she enjoyed fewer freedoms than in America but also felt more appreciated. The work women in her community did was cherished: preparing meals that brought people together, organizing a household to support its members, and maintaining social bonds. In the US we so often praise ambitious careers that bring returns in monetary form that we neglect the work that brings in social returns. Stephen Thomas's article The Legion Lonely underscores the importance of emotional labor largely by analyzing how differently men and women handle social connections and how those connections affect their lives. Our social and emotional sides are a huge part of our lives, contributing to happiness in many ways, including career success, and we should not underestimate it if we wish to live our lives to the fullest.
