Back in 2017 I worked on updating a developer onboarding flow for Kiip, which was one of my earlier experiences working on a developer experience. Then, early this year when I started digging into developer integration docs at Button, I realized this was another developer onboarding experience.

Kiip's Developer Dashboard is a web portal for app developers who wish to integrate Kiip as a monetization solution in their product. While there was already an onboarding flow in place, it needed updates to address existing problems that contributed to drop-offs in the flow and to incorporate new features.

One of the most obvious updates was to redesign the UI of the first registration page to be more professional, appealing and welcoming. Beyond that, many of the problems to be fixed involved changes in the graphic design and user interface for clearer messaging.
