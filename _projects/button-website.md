### Images to pull
- homepage old
- homepage new
- pub/brand split UI
- collected brand and pub pages

### Outline
- what - the Button branding had started to shift, and with a newly staffed marketing team, product messaging had also shifted and we needed to update the site to reflect these changes. 
- so what - however, in the course of evaluating the old website, I identified some areas where the site was not addressing our target audience needs and were also not able to gain insight into the website performance
- now what - took the opportunity to make sure visitors know that Button serves a two sided marketplace right away, so our target users can find the information they're looking for. redesign the navigation to give user holistic view of the site IA, and to optimize the primary "call to action" in the upper right
- outcomes: reduced number of unqualified leads cluttering pipeline, increased time on site? integrated Fullstory for holistic metrics

## Context
In March of 2019 I worked on big redesign of the homepage. It was a blue sky project intended to explore a new visual branding direction and get our team out of a rut so we could rethink how to make Button look like the tech company that it is and wanted to look like. The redesign went well, and this project was the bigger overhaul that followed.

### The Team
- VP of Marketing, business strategy and content
- Marketing team, copywriting
- CEO, CRO, CIO, stakeholders
- Web developer, all things engineering
- Me, design lead

## Problems
User feedback told use that folks usually ended up landing on our homepage after already having some context about Button, whether after talking to a sales rep or attending a conference event. However, once they got to the homepage they didn't know what to do next. The homepage messaging wasn't compelling enough to dive right into the next step, contacting sales, but it wasn't obvious where to go to learn more.

In addition, Button is a two-sided platform (or three-sided depending on if you look at it is B2B or B2B2C), but the website didn't help our users understand where to go for their particular needs.

Didn't know whether folks were logging into the dashboard from the marketing website or what they wanted to know about. We had Google Analytics data but didn't know user flows or whether folks were spending time on content. We were flying blind.

Button branding had started to evolve but the website wasn't up to date.

## Solutions
Nav redesign - based on business strategy input as well as rudimentary Google Analytics data.
Incorporating more ways to dig into info from homepage
Visual design overhaul to reinforce Brands/Pubs content
Integrated Fullstory


## What Came After
As with any product, there were plenty improvements that we designated out of scope for the project, but wanted to address in a future iteration. The ones we later took on included:
- Integrating Contentful so that select sections of website copy could be easily updated by the marketing team
- Developing a resource center to curate white papers, industry news, and thought leadership content
