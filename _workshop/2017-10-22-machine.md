Years ago, I listened to a friend complain about how easily new technology breaks. She was not poorly educated in tech; she was an avid digital photographer, at that moment using Automator to batch edit the day's shots. In response, I argued that people needed to be responsible for staying apprised of how new software and hardware worked. I believed everyone should take the time to intimately understand how everything worked. Don't worry, this was way before I worked on anything that actually affected people.

Since then, I've backpedaledâ€”after all, part of what I do is make things easier to understand. The Coming Software Apocalypse talks about the complexity of coding and how it's a problem that needs to be solved. As author James Somers describes, writing complex software is often like asking a person to work at the bricklayer's perspective while architecting the whole building. In the process, it's all too easy to program something unexpected, possibly with fatal consequences.

The possible solutions focus on changing the way we code, perhaps by making better tools. I think that shift will open up a lot of new and exciting developments in computing. I've also linked some relevant articles about design because I think how we code and how we design are different parts of the same thing.

I know, it's super long, but absolutely a worthwhile read.

Important conversations can be hard. Growing up as "the girl" in the family, I have many memories of being told how I should act because of my gender, and I think about how I would respond if I knew then what I know now. I wonder if it would change the way my family members think. I wonder how much of those experiences have shaped who I am now. Unfortunately, I can't say I've worked up the courage to talk candidly about sexism with my family, but I'm hopeful.

Nothing fancy here, just great oatmeal. I made a batch earlier this week and had breakfast for three mornings. To try to get into the autumn mood, I topped it with chopped up apple, caramel, sliced almonds and cinnamon.
