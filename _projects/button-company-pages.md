Company pages are sensitive things. Like other product and communication design problems, designing company pages is about giving the users (website visitors) the information they're looking for and the features they need (job applications, navigation, etc.). But company pages are also very much branding problems—employer branding in particular. What is this company like to work for? How do we showcase our company culture—the vision that we aspire to as well as the reality that we embody day to day? How do you capture culture in a webpage?

I was not trying to lead an employer branding project here, I was designing a set of web pages for our users and for the Button People Team, the folks who lead the company culture and employer branding. They knew that the existing pages were annoying to navigate (lots of pages), out of date, and could be much more appealing.

The goal of the website was appealing to — potential candidates, customers and prospective customers, press and investors

## Aligning a New Team

I didn't often work with the People Team. I knew that several team members were highly invested in the project, but I wasn't sure if they had a shared vision for the company web pages, so I started with a few alignment exercises for our kick off.

**Aesthetic Alignment** 

Since I was working with a new team of people who were invested in how the end result would look and feel, I started us off with a [Gut Check Test](http://goodkickoffmeetings.com/2010/04/the-20-second-gut-test/) to start a conversation around aesthetics. The test itself is fun, and what is really great is the resulting discussion. It provided an opportunity to start using the same terms to refer to visual patterns and styles so that feedback in the later stages would be clearer.

**User Interviews and Metrics**

I leveraged our recruiting team to ask job candidates 2-3 lightweight questions—realizing these were very biased contexts, since candidates are motivated to keep things positive and are NOT focused on the company's website. I also interviewed new hires to get their impressions of the web pages—again, biased since these folks ultimately were attracted to work at Button.

For other target audiences, I asked our marketing team and sales team for input. Not ideal to get secondhand info, but I'm only one person.

I also gathered some usage data—page visits, device analytics, and such to understand what our audience was looking at already and have a benchmark around 

**Design Workshop**

With insights from the user interviews and the results of the gut check test, I ran a workshop with the whole team where we brainstormed the type of content we expected to see on the website, and some potential layouts—how would folks organize the info?

I used a modified version of the process from Brad Frosts' write up on [Establishing Design Direction](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/establishing-design-direction/). Of course, things always look smoother on paper. The design workshop was challenging because we were crunched for time—in a meeting-heavy organization, finding a 2-3 hour block of time for 5-6 people is possibly the most challenging part. I had to reschedule a few times. Additionally, for participants who aren't used to design or creative work, I had to help them frame the problem multiple times, whether by showing examples of web page sketches, or asking lots of prompting questions to get the brainstorm going.

## Visual Design and Results

All the hard-earned inputs provided some raw ideas for when I put together the page layouts. Front loading the alignment exercises helped make the stakeholder reviews at this stage smoother. The designs reflected the goals and decisions we discussed, and when folks gave feedback, they drew from the vocabulary and discussions from earlier to communicate clearly.

One of the deliverables included fun icons to represent the employee benefits. I created some of these and art directed others created by [Jessica Braga](http://jessicabraga.com/).

The web developer, Jeff, built out my designs in small pieces so that we could roll out small changes quickly and monitor for any bugs or performance changes.

### Lessons

In an ideal world, there is a comprehensive benchmark to compare results to. In this case, metrics like
