[Mobility: Struggling Americans Are Stuck](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/markets/struggling-americans-once-sought-greener-pastures-and-now-theyre-stuck/ar-AApjqTP) (10 min read)  
When I read an article like this, I'm reminded how little I know about other people's lives. This story mainly follows a young woman, Taylor, whose life seems, superficially, easy enough to understand: small town, public school, swim team, college. However, where it was easy—in fact, expected—for me and most of my peers to graduate college and subsequently find jobs in big cities, it wasn't for Taylor and many others.

[Invisibilia: Bubble Hopping](http://pca.st/ZFbz) (30 min listen)   
This episode of Invisibilia came out a while ago, but I didn't get around to listening to it until this week. The hosts interview two people who have taken the idea of breaking out of their bubbles really seriously. One woman tries to really understand dogs; a man develops an app that forces him out of his daily routines. It's pretty fascinating, but I wish the interviewee's had delved deeper into how these experiences change their views of the world.

[The Broken Bail System - Changes in New Jersey](http://www.npr.org/sections/money/2017/07/12/536905881/episode-783-new-jersey-bails-out)  (19 min listen)   
Hey New Jerseans, this is really interesting. New Jersey recently (maybe a month ago) revamped its bail system, and it's absolutely fascinating. I'm actually kind of proud the state is trying to make big changes to its criminal justice system, even if I'm not entirely sure if this will turn out well.

[Honey Lemon Chicken Bowls &#x7c; Meal Planning](https://www.gimmesomeoven.com/honey-lemon-chicken-bowls-meal-prep/)   
Okokok, I have to disclose that I haven't actually tried this recipe yet. Meal planning or any sort of planning ahead in regards to food is difficult, so when I see a recipe or an easy tip for meal planning, I jump on it. I'm planning to make this soon though, so I'll report back.
