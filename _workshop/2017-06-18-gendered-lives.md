After reading the below articles this week, I started to think about (surprise) gender stereotypes again. More and more, I've read and conversed about gender politics with the idea in mind that we all need to recognize the biases we've learned and the systemic discrimination that is daily reinforced in through our culture. Sometimes, though, it's simpler than that. Sometimes gender stereotypes and expectations are tied right to how much time we have on this earth.

For women, a major expectation is that of bearing children. There's no shortage of literature and dialogue about the mental and physical effects of childbirth on women (although the research results support conflicting arguments). For men, the expectations are a bit more overarching and center around being "manly," which can manifest as an obsession with work and career among other things. In both cases, our choices to conform to gender expectations shape not only how we live but also how long we live. Childbearing might have a more obvious connection in this respect, but Mark Manson's article, rather dramatically titled, cites many sources that link traditionally male traits with life expectancy.

At one point, gender roles and expectations probably served their purpose well, but it's a sobering thought to consider how deeply their effects reach into our lives.
