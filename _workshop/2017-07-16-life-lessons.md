It's a short one this week and perhaps a bit disjointed. I found this Quartz article pretty interesting, but I warn you it's a listicle. It turns a critical eye on some of the common life lessons that kids hear. While we may not be in positions to think about dishing out life advice to children, I think many of us will recall similar lessons as part of our childhoods. Maybe we've internalized some of them and aren't even fully aware of it.

The first one made me hesitate. Focusing on the future was a theme my parents often reiterated, and I think it's made me (somewhat) better at planning, checking my perspective, and handling money. However, I focused on the future without figuring out what I wanted that future to look like, and I didn't know how to figure it out. I'm sure part of that is just living life—there are lessons you don't really learn until you've been in the exact situation—but part of it was also not slowing down to consider my present state and what I wanted. I suppose as in all things, these lessons aren't necessarily problematic; they just need to be moderated.
