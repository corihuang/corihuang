*The Button Design team shared a weekly newsletter with the entire company to bring folks into our work and generally brighten everyone's day. I wrote this issue just after the company closed the physical office and went fully remote due to COVID-19*

The theme of this week is visual design that unites us. Visual design is about communication, and we’re digging into how designers use the commonalities between people to communicate clearly and bring us together.

## Design That Unites Us
To communicate well, we need to recognize the spectrum of human perception and interpretation. For designers, psychology and inclusiveness touch all parts of the design process, so this week, we'll look at how we take visual perception abilities into account and bring people into the design process.

**Visual Perception**

Common Regions - We tend to see things enclosed together as related or connected in some way. In the example below, the circles in the same rectangles look related, even if they’re different colors. Consider how a “card” on a website helps us group info.

Closure - Similar to the Common Regions idea, we tend to see things as larger wholes instead of processing multiple smaller things. In the example below, you’ll notice it’s easier to resolve each image as a familiar object—soccer ball, white triangle (and circles), and a panda—rather than seeing the more complex black shapes, like the skewed hexagons, three Pac-mans, and I don’t know what that shape is called.

**Color Vision Variance**

The human eye is much more sensitive to an object’s perceived brightness than its exact color. In fact, about 1 in 12 men and 1 in 200 women from Northern European decent suffer from some colorblindness, so it’s important to ensure important visual elements have a high color contrast with their backgrounds.

In this example, the top row has a contrast ratio of 2.33:1, which is not enough to pass accessibility standards for text, but the second has a ratio of 5.53:1, so we’re in the clear!

## Design Workshops

Many of you have been in a design thinking workshop at Button. They're meant to bring together a multidisciplinary group of people to pool expertise and understand the problem from various perspectives. A well-known case study is the [IDEO Shopping Cart](https://usebutton.us19.list-manage.com/track/click?u=3bdab5c2586547cfd448cc5f4&id=35a98b1af3&e=767ae73873), a project that brought together experts from psychology, engineering, business, linguistics, marketing, and even biology to redesign the supermarket shopping cart in one week. Ask a designer about how you can use a workshop in your next project.

## Tips & Tricks

**Guide Users with Visual Hierarchy**
Bigger text is usually reserved for headings. The most important thing on the page is usually the “loudest”—the most colorful, highest contrast, largest. The least important things are usually the smallest and least colorful.


**Create Quick Callouts in Preview**
Preview is more powerful than you might think. Ever take a screenshot and need to call out a button or where to find a setting? Try using the Preview “loupe tool.”
