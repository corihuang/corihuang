This is really multiple projects that I've combined in order to tell the whole story. This is a company branding and storytelling project and a website product design project.

Button, like many startups and really most ideas in early stages, was figuring out its identity and product at the same time, while continuing to clarify the company mission. It's a confusing time because there's a lot of chicken-and-egg moments.

## Context
In March of 2019 I worked on big redesign of the homepage. It was a blue sky project intended to explore a new visual branding direction and get our team out of a rut so we could rethink how to make Button look like the tech company that it is and wanted to look like. The redesign went well, and this project was the bigger overhaul that followed.

**The Team**
- VP of Marketing, business strategy and content
- Marketing team, copywriting
- CEO, CRO, CIO, stakeholders
- Web developer, all things engineering
- Me, design lead

## Visual Identity
The brand voice and message had been defined by the marketing team. I took that messaging and translated it into Button's visual identity. Button cannot be everything to everyone; the company is a tech company, and its product are for businesses that want to succeed in the mobile commerce space. We needed our target audience to know that on their first impression.

## User Journey
User feedback told use that folks usually ended up landing on our homepage after already having some context about Button, whether after talking to a sales rep or attending a conference event. However, once they got to the homepage they didn't know what to do next. The homepage messaging wasn't compelling enough to dive right into the next step, contacting sales, but it wasn't obvious where to go to learn more.

**Multiple Audiences**

Rethinking the information architecture for a two-sided marketplace. The Button website has four target audience groups, and by necessity we prioritized customers first. This was reflected in how we reworked the website navigation UI. According to user interviews and stakeholder input, users didn't always recognized which content was for them. To help users find the information most relevant to them, I added an element on the homepage that immediately gives the user the two sides of the marketplace. took the opportunity to make sure visitors know that Button serves a two sided marketplace right away, so our target users can find the information they're looking for. redesign the navigation to give user holistic view of the site IA, and to optimize the primary "call to action" in the upper right

As users navigate throughout the site, there is also a color shift between the different sections--the homepage and other default pages, the pages for Brands, pages for Publishers, and the company section.

**What Came After**

As with any product, there were plenty improvements that we designated out of scope for the project, but wanted to address in a future iteration. The ones we later took on included:
- Integrating Contentful so that select sections of website copy could be easily updated by the marketing team
- Developing a resource center to curate white papers, industry news, and thought leadership content
