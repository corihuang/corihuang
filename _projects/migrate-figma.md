We knew we could work better, but we didn't know how to make the shift together.

---

In 2019, the Button design team was new and figuring out how to stay in sync while each designer was embedded on a different product team. We were using Sketch, InVision, and Abstract (and Dropbox, which we never fully shook) as our tool kit to design, prototype, and collaborate.

With this set up, we had trouble keeping track of each others' and shared files, and the bus factor on every project was 1. Newer designers also had little context on the existing component library. The ideal tool would enable the team to easily share assets and documentation so we could build off of each other's work. Additionally, we needed to be able to move seamlessly between designing, prototyping, and sharing work with stakeholders and engineers.

From our team retrospectives, it was clear we were ready to make a change. I took on this project because I wanted to improve the way we worked as a team and to lay the foundation for our design system. Through this project, I had the opportunity to do some internal user research, create a migration plan, and manage communication across departments. I also got pretty good at pitching Figma ;)

## Process (How Do You Actually Do the Thing?)

There are lots of posts online about why to switch to Figma and what to expect when you switch, but how do you make the transition successful?

**Logistics & Communication**

An unsung hero here is a good old spreadsheet. I spent a good chunk of time on documentation I need to track feature comparisons and feedback, and I also needed to keep others in the loop. I created a timeline and plan for testing InVision (Enterprise with DSM) and Figma, making decisions, migrating our services, and communicating.

Button is a highly collaborative company, so it was important to communicate proactively and provide a feedback channel for those who might be impacted. Collecting feedback from the team was easy, and I also reached out regularly to our collaborators on the product, engineering, and marketing teams. No one had major reservations, but speaking to different folks helped fill blind spots for the transition.

**Solutions & Trade-offs**

Developed a matrix for comparing the tools, which took into account feature comparison, pricing, friction to onboard. reduce friction - does the new set up actually help us work easier? how does it simplify small barriers, like opening multiple apps, file structure, not being able to find things

One challenge I came up against during this process was a fear of moving to the `.fig` file type—this migration would make it harder to access our archive of design files and prototypes, and we weren't sure if we could convert `.fig` files back to Sketch if we changed our minds later. I found it was helpful to remind the team not to be too precious. At the end of the day, we don't ship Sketch files or InVision prototypes. Those are the artifacts, the documents that help convey intentions for the final product. It's okay to lose some of the artifacts once they are no longer useful—once the product is shipped or the experiment is run, as long as we know it existed and what happened.

In a world where storage is cheap and we can keep pristine, digital copies of everything, the desire to archive and have full access to everything in history is strong.

Finally, with all factors weighed, I felt strongly that we should move forward with Figma. A final vote within the design team for Figma aligned us all, and I assuaged the concerns and answered questions from other teams. With that it was a matter of getting the service up by going through our internal vendor approval process, communicating with all folks impacted, getting the team set up, and running a few training sessions.

## Results

The benefits of moving to Figma, especially for small teams, is well document on the internet.
- Consolidating services and files
- Keeping everyone in sync with file versions
- Smoother collaboration — built-in commenting, real-time collaboration
- Better design system support

Based on positive feedback from the design team and our collaborators, the transition was successful, and we realized these benefits. After we had Figma set up, I also brought in Zeroheight as our design system documentation tool since it integrates easily and stays up to date.

### What Did I Learn?

Every project comes with lessons. I learned to better anticipate others' needs: some folks are on board with you and need to see that you're confident. Other folks want an opportunity to be involved in the conversation, and still others just want the tl;dr to be keep apprised. These are all important.

This project was also a great exercise in leadership. Even though I was convinced from the beginning that Figma would be a good change, it was scary to make a decision that would impact other people—and be held accountable for it. I risked potentially wasting time, blocking productivity, and increasing frustration, but being able to weigh the risks, make the call, and be accountable for the results are all parts of leadership.
