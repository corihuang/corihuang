The overarching theme among these articles and videos is how to live better—self-improvement essentially, but I actually want to say that I don't want to obsess over self-improvement.

On the one hand, I love reading fascinating pieces like the interview with James Buettner in The Atlantic. Buettner's job is to travel the world to find and interview the healthiest people, and of course I want to know how the healthiest people in the world live their lives so that I can do the same. Similarly, I watched Edward De Bono's Thinking Course (originally aired on BBC, and now brought to you in grainy Youtube videos) in the hopes that I could get better at approaching problems in creative ways. I think they're all worthwhile reads/watches.

On the other hand, I realize if I spend my whole day reading these, I'm not actually implementing any self-improvements. Besides, in the midst of the consumption frenzy, I forget that I have a perfectly average brain that's capable of thinking and working some of this out for myself. As Edward De Bono says, "one of the main purposes of thinking is to go from things we know to things we don't know." It just tends to be easier to Google answers to our lives rather than think and make decisions.

Buettner has some unusual, in my opinion, ways of looking at happiness. He looks at happiness like a retirement portfolio in that he tries to keep it "balanced—the short term and long term, stocks and bonds." He also has insights into how the happiest people around the world live.

Just watch this, it will make you actually want to use your brain.

Here's another perspective I never thought about: a lot of self-help advice frames happiness as journey of self-discovery (finding your passion, setting goals, accepting yourself), but happiness is also the natural byproduct of engaging with the world.

Need a pep talk? Here's a listicle with a click-bait title, but I found some of it to be very motivational.

Meg Robichaud gives as some real talk on working remotely, especially as a remote manager. Her insights into the challenges (to productivity, work boundaries, communication and social health) that come with remote work really illuminate what you might need to know if you want to do it. I also think it helps to highlight why being in the office is great and what you should get out of your in-office days.

"It’s 2017 and you work on the internet. Don’t pretend like you don’t know how pissed off you seem when you suddenly switch to short declarative sentences. You’re a professional communicator and we’re supposed to believe you’re oblivious to how draining a giant block of text feels? Come on. Did you just double dot at me..?"

If you work in anything remotely tech-related this will be funny.

[Desperation Spaghetti Carbonara](https://www.chowhound.com/recipes/vegetarian-spaghetti-carbonara-31336)  
I made spaghetti carbonara for the first time! I think it is as easy as advertised, unless you happen to be in a foreign kitchen and can't find the pots or the garlic. This version from Serious Eats is super stripped down in case you haven't been to the grocery store in two weeks, but if you aren't quite so desperate, definitely add bacon (or some other cured meat; dice up and cook it at the beginning) and some green peas (add them at the end).
